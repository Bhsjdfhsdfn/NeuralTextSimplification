# Exploring Neural Text Simplification

## Abstract
We present the first attempt at using sequence to sequence neural networks to model text simplification (TS). Unlike the previously proposed automated methods, our neural text simplification (NTS) systems are able to simultaneously perform lexical simplification and content reduction. An extensive human evaluation of the output has shown that NTS systems achieve good grammaticality and meaning preservation of output sentences and higher level of simplification than the state-of-the-art automated TS systems. We train our models on the [Wikipedia corpus](http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/tial/projects/simplification) containing _good_ and _good partial_ alignments.

## Simplify Text | Generate Predictions (no GPUs needed)
1. OpenNMT dependencies
    1. [Install Torch](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html)
    2. Install additional packages:
    ```bash
	luarocks install tds
    ```
2. Checkout the OpenNMT source:
```bash
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
```
3. Download the pre-trained released models [NTS]() and [NTS-w2v]() (this may take a while):
```bash
   python models/download.py
```
4. Run translate.sh from the scripts dir:
```bash
   cd src/scripts
   ./translate.sh
```
5. Check the predictions in the results directory:
```bash
   cd ../../results_NTS
```
6. Run automatic evaluation metrics
    1. Install the python requirements (only nltk is needed)
    ```bash
       pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    2. Run the evaluate script
    ```bash
       python src/evaluate.py ./data/test.en ./data/references/references.tsv ./predictions/
    ```

## Content of this Repository
#### ./predictions
Contains predictions from previous systems (Wubben et al., 2012), (Glavas and Stajner, 2015), and (Xu et al., 2016), and the generated predictions of the NTS models reported in the paper:
- NTS_default_b5_h1 - the default model, beam size 5, hypothesis 1
- NTS_BLEU_b12_h1 - the BLEU best ranked model, beam size 12, hypothesis 1
- NTS_SARI_b5_h2 - the SARI best ranked model, beam size 12, hypothesis 1

- NTS-w2v_default_b5_h1 - the default model, beam size 5, hypothesis 1
- NTS-w2v_BLEU_b12_h1 - the BLEU best ranked model, beam size 12, hypothesis 1
- NTS-w2v_SARI_b12_h2 - the SARI best ranked model, beam size 12, hypothesis 2

#### ./data 
Contains the training, testing, and [reference](https://github.com/cocoxu/simplification) sentences used to train and evaluate our models.

#### ./models
Contains a script to download the pre-trained models. The models are released to be usable on machines with or without GPUs. They can't be used to continue the training session. In case the download.py script fails, you may use the direct links for [NTS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_pjS_ZjPfT9QjFsZThCU0xUTnM) and [NTS-w2v](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_pjS_ZjPfT9U1pJNy1UdV9nNk0)

#### ./configs
Contains the OpenNMT config file. To train, please update the config file with the appropriate data on your local system and run 
```bash
	th train -config $PATH_TO_THIS_DIR/configs/NTS.cfg
```
#### ./src 
- **train_word2vec.py** a script that creates a word2vec model from a local corpus, using gensim
- **SARI.py** a copy of the [SARI](https://github.com/cocoxu/simplification) implementation
- **evaluate.py** evaluates BLEU and SARI scores given a source file, a directory of predictions and a reference file in tsv format
- **./scripts** - contains some of our scripts that we used to preprocess the data, output translations, and create the concatenated embeddings
- **./OpenNMT** - the patch with some changes that need to be applied to the latest checkout of OpenNMT. 
Alternatively, one could use [our forked code](https://github.com/senisioi/OpenNMT/) directly.
